JavaScript::RPC - Remote procedure calls from JavaScript

JavaScript::RPC uses client side javascript to call perl scripts on
the server that will return data for the javascript to parse using
DHTML.

The client side library is by Brent Ashley (http://www.ashleyit.com/rs/).
His distribution comes with a perl server, but I wasn't terribly happy
with it. Thus, i wrote my own (JavaScript::RPC::Server::CGI).
