NAME
    JavaScript::RPC - (DEPRECATED) Remote procedure calls from JavaScript

DEPRECATION NOTICE
    Brent Ashley, the author of JSRS, has stated that he has no plans to
    update his library. JavaScript RPC, more commonly known as "AJAX", has
    seen a rise in popularity and therefore many new libraries have been
    released. You should consider those alternatives before trying to use
    this module and the JSRS library.
